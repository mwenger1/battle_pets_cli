### BattlePets

Before setting up the game to play, you must download and follow the
install instructions for [BattlePets
Management](https://github.com/mwenger1/battle_pets_management) and [BattlePets
Arena](coming soon).

Once those services are running locally, this CLI game is ready to be installed.
First install the necessary gems with:

```
# If you don't have bundler
gem install bundler

# Once bundler is installed
bundle install
```

Then start play with:
```
ruby script.rb
```
